
Dear

The situation is that we have got a number of applications and i have compiles a
short list of 3 applicant of which you are one. Unfortunately i cauth a flue
after returning from the CDC conference in Cancan, Mexico and was not in a
position where i could carry out the planned skype interview with you.

I hope the situation has changed so much that we can carry out the skype 
interview with you before New year. I suggest you pick two instants of time 
(10:00, 11:00, 13:00, 14:00 or 15:00) on the following dates:

Tuesday 23.12
Monday 29.12
Tuesday 30.12

and send it to mee.  I don't know the precise tradition at your home, but i 
hope to have avoided the most obvious vacations days. I also recognize the 23.12
is a bit too short notice, but i was not able to produce a prediction of my 
health with a reasonable precision before now.

Sorry for any inconvenience.

Best regards

Niels poulsen
